# Crowd-Facial-Emotion-Detection

Emotions are mental states that result from neurophysiological changes and can be associated with thoughts, feelings, behavior, and a degree of pleasure or displeasure. While face detection technology has been around for a while, the ability to detect emotions being displayed on the face is now possible. This technology is becoming increasingly important for gauging the emotions and reactions of people in a crowd, which can be useful for making informed decisions related to intent identification, promotion of offers, and security-related threats. Social signal processing is used for Emotion recognition by using wide range of applications. However, recognizing simple emotions like anger, happiness, contempt, fear, sadness, and surprise is still a cumbersome task in the crowd. Deep learning techniques, particularly Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), is used to solve the real-world problem on crowd emotions. In this project, we implemented CNN-based deep learning techniques to analyze facial expressions and detect the emotions being displayed by individuals in a crowd.
